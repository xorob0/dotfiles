[pass-rotate]
# A shell command that prints a password for an account. For example, for
# the "pass" password manager, you could use this command:
#
# get-password=pass show "$ACCOUNT"
#
# The $ACCOUNT environment variable will be replaced with the account name.
#
get-password=

# A shell command that creates and prints a new password for an account. For
# example, for the "pass" password manager, you could use this command:
#
# gen-password=pass generate -f "$ACCOUNT"
#
# The $ACCOUNT environment variable will be replaced with the account name.
# After the password is generated, get-password will be used to read it back.
#
gen-password=

# Service provider configs follow:
#
# [service-name]
# options...
#
# The name of the service should match the name your password manager uses, and
# will used in the get-password and gen-password commands.
#
# options... varies from service provider to service provider, but the
# following options are common:
#
# domain=... will specify the domain of the service provider, which is used to
# match the provider-specific password reset mechanism. If omitted, the default
# is to use the service name as the domain.
#
# Most providers will only ask for username=, but others may require some
# additional information. Use pass-rotate --list-options [provider] to learn
# what options are available for each service provider.
